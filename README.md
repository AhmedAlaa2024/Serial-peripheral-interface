# Serial-peripheral-interface

Course Name: Advanced Logic Design<br>
Course Code: CMP1050<br>

This is an educational project for Advanced Logic Design, written in Verilog (Hardware Descriptive Language) using Modelsim Intel FPGA IDE. Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is one of the most widely used interfaces
between microcontroller and peripheral ICs such as sensors, ADCs, DACs,
shift registers, SRAM, and others. This article provides a brief description
of the SPI interface followed by an introduction to Analog Devicesâ€™ SPI
enabled switches and muxes, and how they help reduce the number of
digital GPIOs in system board design.
